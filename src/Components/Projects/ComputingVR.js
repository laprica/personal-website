          <p>NCWIT EXPRESSIONS OF COMPUTING VR CHALLENGE WINNER</p>

          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>CoSpaces allows for the spaces to be viewed on the browser, in Virtual Reality, on normal-flat mobile, or by using a mobile VR headset which was interesting to work with, because all of these platforms have a different set of inputs. The challenge was to create an experience to be shown to middle schoolers to convince them to pursue a career in computer science. I will have a video showing the different experiences, but I will explain them now as well. The original experience I made for the contest consists of a main classroom area that links to three other areas. The classroom consisted of students learning about different applications of computer science: simulation, accessibility, entertainment. Simulation had the student 'take apart' a computer to see the inside, accessibility had the student transported to an outside concert, and entertainment transported the student to a tilt-ball game. After the game, I had a small 'peek behind the curtains' explaining how I made the game. This is the part that the judges ended up liking a lot, and after the contest I expanded the work on the game, providing clearer explanations and adding more background details.</p>
          <p>NCWIT held a competition to use CoSpaces.io to create a virtual reality (VR) experience to encourage young women to explore careers in computer science. My submission included recreating a game of tilt-ball, where the user tilts a platform to move a ball to a goal. I then explain different parts that went into making the game, from initial plan to different tests and math that went into the design of the game. Below is a video showcasing a final submission.</p>
