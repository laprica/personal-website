              â€‹CREATED FOR CMU CARNIVAL 2015</p>
          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>The Origami Club wanted to do something for CMU's yearly Spring Carnival, and someone thought that it would be great to make an origami petting zoo.</p>
          <h2>Project</h2>
          <p>We got giant paper (9 ft photo backdrop paper!) and folded giant animals out of them. We put aluminum foil into the animals and used the Capacitive Sense library for Arduino to have the animals make noise when petted. </p>
