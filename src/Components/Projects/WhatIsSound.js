          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>â€‹The Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science at Stony Brook University poses a different question each year for scientists around the world to explain to 11-year-olds. The 2016 question for the Flame Challenge was "What is sound?" I found out about this contest about a month before the deadline, conveniently during winter break. I taught myself Adobe After Effects and made the video below.</p>
