          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>This is a project which combines my love of origami with my desire to put LEDs on things. I wanted to make a foldable LED screen. Exploring this lead me to discover a vastly unexplored frontier of thick origami. It started as a Build18 2014 project and grown to be so much more.</p>

          <h2>Project</h2>
          <p>Folding paper is easy when compared to folding cardboard. New rules about folding have to be considered when taking the thickness of the material you are working with into account. I had to find these new rules if I wanted to be able to fold LED screens, and found quickly that there is not much literature out there.</p>
          <p>There are several papers by Lang and Tomohiro Tachi and some other guys talking about different ways to take this thickness into account. </p>
